# JavaScript Workshop #5 – Array & Object Mastery  

Practice exercises focused on modern JavaScript array methods and data manipulation.

### Task 1 – Nested Arrays  
Given a nested array, dynamically calculate:  
- The sum of each sub-array  
- The total sum of all numbers in the entire structure  

(No hard-coded indexing like `arr[0][1]` allowed — use loops or array methods.)

### Task 2 – Students Data  
Work with an array of student objects containing name, grades, and active status. Complete the following:  
1. Create an array of student names in UPPERCASE  
2. Return only active students  
3. Log each student’s status (e.g., “Ana is an active student”)  
4. Check if every student has an average grade > 50 (return boolean)  
5. Check if at least one student has an average grade > 90 (return boolean)  
6. Find the student named “Maya”  

### Methods Used  
`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `flat`, `every`, `some`, `find`, `forEach`
