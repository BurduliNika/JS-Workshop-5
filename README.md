JavaScript Workshop #5 – Array & Object Mastery
Practice exercises focused on modern JavaScript array methods and data manipulation.
Task 1 – Nested Arrays
Given a nested array, dynamically calculate:

The sum of each sub-array
The total sum of all numbers in the entire structure

(No hard-coded indexing like arr[0][1] allowed — use loops or array methods.)
Task 2 – Students Data
Work with an array of student objects containing name, grades, and active status. Complete the following:

Create an array of student names in UPPERCASE
Return only active students
Log each student’s status (e.g., “Ana is an active student”)
Check if every student has an average grade > 50 (return boolean)
Check if at least one student has an average grade > 90 (return boolean)
Find the student named “Maya”

Methods Used
map, filter, reduce, flat, every, some, find, forEach
